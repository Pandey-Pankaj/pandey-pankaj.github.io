I study neural oscillations with the aim of contributing to Neurotechnology. I am fortunate to pursue my passion for brain science at IITGN. I am thankful to my supervisor [Dr. Krishna Prasad Miyapuram](https://iitgn.ac.in/faculty/cse/krishna) and mentor [Dr. Derek Lomas](https://www.tudelft.nl/io/over-io/personen/lomas-j-d) for guiding me to develop the vision. I receive Prime Minister's Fellowship with Industry Partner [PlayPower Labs](https://www.playpowerlabs.com/) for my doctoral research.

I mostly think with the following perspectives in my work:
======
1. Signal Processing [Time Series]
1. Machine and Deep Learning [Representation] 
1. Cognitive Science [Mind] 
1. Physics [Oscillatory System]
1. Philosophy [Meaning]
